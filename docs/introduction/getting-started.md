6. **Add each scholar’s account** by filling in the following information:

* Account name (i.e. scholar-01)
* Ronin address (this is the account your scholar plays on)
* Scholar’s % revenue share

After entering your scholar’s %, the manager’s % revenue share will be automatically updated to equal 100%.
