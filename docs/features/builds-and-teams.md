# Builds & Teams

Our Builds & Teams feature allows you to create your Axie Build preset, and to create meta team presets consisting of your Builds. In a single click, you’ll be able to **automatically generate and distribute teams** according to those conditions.

## Build Templates
To **create a build**, click into “Create Build” on the top right.

1. First, give your Axie build a name
2. Select the class under “Axie Type”
3. _Optionally_ choose as many genes for each Axie body part

To **create a general Axie build template** of a class (i.e. beast) with no specific parts in mind, simply choose the Axie Type and leave all parts blank.

To create a “Backdoor Bird” build by selecting the following characteristics in the drop-down menu under each relevant part:

* Kestrel horns
* Hare eyes
* Little owl mouth
* Cupid back
* All bird parts eyes
* All bird parts ears

Easily **edit or delete each build** (on the right). 

Now that you’ve created your builds, it’s time to **create your first team template**.

If you know which team combinations work, go ahead and enter a name for your team preset, and select 3 Axie builds for the team.

When you’re done building your desired teams, they’ll all appear under “Teams.” Edit, delete, or drag to rank.

## Team Templates

The next step is to match all of your Axies into teams according to your Team presets.

To distribute Teams to empty wallets, **you must have [Wallet Commander](wallet-commander.md) installed**.

Below, you’ll see this scholarship has automatically distributed their Axies into 538 teams, according to their meta – beast, aqua and plant. In one click, 1,614 beast, aqua and plant Axies were sent to 538 ronin wallets– a task that would’ve otherwise taken hours.

Any remaining **Axies that don’t fit the Team template** will be unmatched, the total of which you’ll see under “Unmatched Axies.”

To **send teams to empty wallets**, click “Distribute Teams,” which will automatically dispense every team of matched Axies into an empty wallet.

If you see a number of Axies in “Matched Axies With No Available Wallets,” it means these **teams have been matched, but there are no empty wallets** for them to go into. To add an empty wallet, head to Wallet and add an empty one.

Like payments, select [Wallet Commander](wallet-commander.md) from the Settings menu to watch the **team distribution updated on the blockchain in real time**. Et voilà!
